# learn-rust

I'm learning Rust from [examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

Goal is trying to get to know the syntax, concept, paradigm...

Also trying to solve every example's `Activity` challenge by the end of each section.

I am very fascinated by [their ecosystem and tooling](https://github.com/topics/rust).

Hope to build some tool by the end of it. :rocket:
